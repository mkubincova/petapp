<strong>Pet Society</strong> is a social media web application for pet owners. 
Once registered, users can create public profiles for their pets, write posts and comments or check how to take care of various animal species.
The project also includes a small API which shows a different animal fact every time the user visits the "My pets" page.

To try it out you need to run the project locally (I used XAMPP) and create a MySQL database with the code from the <i>create-db.sql</i> file.
For the api you need to create a database "petfacts" with two attributes (factID, text) and adjust the path in php code.
